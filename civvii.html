The game was developed by Studio Lillie and released on Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux on May 29th, 2021.<br><br>
In Civilization VII, the player leads their chosen civilization from the dawn of agriculture through to the far future, hoping to achieve one of many victory conditions. The player must carefully handle many different variables and react to changing conditions, managing research, diplomacy, exploration, expansion, development, and conquest. The game is heavily based upon Civilization VI, retaining many of its changes, while also adding new features, such as new Tribe and Plague systems, a revamp of the combat system, and the return of some previously removed systems like the World Congress.</p></div></div>

<br>
<br>
These Districts perform the same sort of effect, but are no longer specialized for a certain type of resource. Instead, you may now build any type of building in any District or City Center that you so desire, including duplicates within the same city. At first, only three Buildings may be built in one District, but certain Technologies may increase this amount.
<br>
<br>
Specialization is still encouraged, if not necessary. Each Building relates to a certain Type Bonus; Buildings that generated Science are Research Types, for instance. Having multiple of these same types in a District will give boosts to the city it belongs to. These include boosts to yields as well as more complex benefits at higher levels.
<br>
<br>
<span class="expand">BONUSES</span>
<br>
<br>
Adjacency bonuses also return. Rather than simply giving additional yields, they will now contribute to the District's Type Bonuses. For example, building a District near two Hills may give it a Industrial Type Bonus, contributing to what already has been built there. This encourages players to build Districts based on what bonuses they get, as well as what Buildings already occupy that District.</p></div></div>

<br>
<br>
Each city begins with two open Trade Slots. By producing and using a Trader unit, these Slots can be filled. Each Slot represents a different City that the City is trading with. Each Trade Route creates yields based on the Buildings in the recipient city. If the receiving city has a District with 3 Industrial Type Buildings, for instance, the Trade Route is likely to give 2 Production.
<br>
<br>
Trader Units are more valuable than ever. While they no longer are used to actually do the Trading, they are still used to establish Trade Routes. Each one has 2 charges when it is created, and one is used with each action. Traders must be used to establish Trade Routes, change Trade Routes, or later on, boost the amount of Trade Slots that a City has.
<br>
<br>
Plundering Trade can now only be done during a City Siege, giving the pillager equal to 15 turns of the yield of the route.</p></div></div>
